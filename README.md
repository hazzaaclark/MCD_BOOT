# MCD_BOOT

A Generic, all purpose solution to sideloading custom software onto the SEGA MEGA CD

# Motive:

This project serves to provide the sole foundation by which developers are able to create software for the MEGA CD

Sideloading your own content onto the console through this bootloader, which houses all of the necessary functionality for getting started

## Featuring the following:

- CDDA Support (in compliance with BIOS standard)

- Relevant header checks and subroutines for working natively

- Functionality for statically casted macros for ease of use development

- (WIP) PCM audio driver support for full 44100KHz audio
